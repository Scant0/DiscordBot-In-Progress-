Step 1: Create a file ".env" under "TB" directory (with main.py & requirements.txt)
- Inside .env file paste (without quotation marks) "DISCORD_TOKEN=DISCORD_TOKEN_HERE" - Enter your bot token after "="

/cogs/presence.py (bot status & activity) is restricted to admin role via ID - Change the ID to suit your server or remove the string of code
"# --- Role restriction ---
ADMIN_ROLE_IDS = {1415420040366526656}  # replace with your Admin role ID(s)"

All other files are general setup & can be customised accordingly.
